### Summary:

* In this project, I utilized a database covering the NYC Taxi system to create and make changes to the database.


#### Dataset:

* The dataset I utilized makes use of a Freedom of Information request submitted to the NYC Taxi and Limousines department. Specifically, this dataset summarizes the active cars for each medallion ID, and the total trips charged for the provided day.
* The data includes every ride taken within January and February of 2015.
* In total, there are 355 such records across the two months.

#### Main File
The main file executes each of these commands and notes the method. I was able to have each of these methods executed after importing from the query file.

#### Reflection Questions

* In SQLite, one challenge I had was the proper format to assign variables to each of the columns, as conducted using the question marks. This felt like the formatting conducted within Python, but was actually utilized to impact the SQL database.
